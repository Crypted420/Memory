# Memory

Memory is a NodeJS Web Application for keeping records in an old-school UI way. I created Memory to explore the capability of NodeJS being new to NodeJS.
It was created with -
- Express
- Pug (View engine)
- Sass
- MongoDB
- GSAP (Animation Library)
- Vanilla JavaScript :)
 
 Functionalities:
 - Authentication (**Passport**)
 - Password encryption (crypto)
 - Password Reset (Nodemailer *fun working with*)
 - Route Control
 - Record Creation
 - Record deletion
 - User profile editing
 - Logout (Express session)

Feel free to folk and make recommendations on better codes because the code is quite not impressive coming from someone new to Node.
